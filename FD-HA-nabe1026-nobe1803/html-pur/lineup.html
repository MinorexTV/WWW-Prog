            <p>They are regularly cited as the progenitors of both hard rock and heavy metal. Their sound has been
                imitated by bands
                from Black Sabbath to Nirvana. They also inspired hard rock bands to include acoustic elements in their
                music and were
                among the first to experiment with Indian and North African music. Page’s style—both his solos and
                riffs—has served as
                an important model for most rock guitarists, and Bonham is often cited as the model for metal or hard
                rock drumming.</p>
