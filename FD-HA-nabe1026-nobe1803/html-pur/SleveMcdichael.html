        <h1>Sleve McDichael</h1>

        <p>They are regularly cited as the progenitors of both hard rock and heavy metal. Their sound has been
            imitated by bands
            from Black Sabbath to Nirvana. They also inspired hard rock bands to include acoustic elements in their
            music and were
            among the first to experiment with Indian and North African music. Page’s style—both his solos and
            riffs—has served as
            an important model for most rock guitarists, and Bonham is often cited as the model for metal or hard
            rock drumming.</p>
